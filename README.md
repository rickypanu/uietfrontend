üèó System Architecture
1.User Login/Registration
    Students, Teachers, and Admins register via the frontend.
    Data is sent securely to FastAPI backend and stored in MongoDB.
    Admin approves registrations before the user can access dashboards.
2.OTP-Based Attendance (Teacher ‚Üí Student)
    Teacher generates a unique OTP for the class.
    OTP is stored in the backend database.
    Students enter OTP on frontend to mark attendance.
    Backend validates OTP and marks attendance in MongoDB.
3.Face Recognition Attendance
    Students can mark attendance via face recognition.
    Frontend captures student image.
    Image encoding is sent to backend.
    Backend compares it with stored face encodings.
    If matched, attendance is marked in MongoDB.
4.Dashboard & History
    Backend fetches real-time attendance data and sends it to frontend.
    Students see their attendance history with filters.
    Teachers see daily class attendance and summary analytics.
5.Notifications System
    Teachers send notifications via frontend.
    Backend stores notifications in MongoDB.
    Students fetch and view notifications in real-time.
6.Admin Module
    Admin can approve/reject registrations, delete users, or manage data.
    All actions are reflected in the database and accessible via dashboards.
